# ev-2025

A generalized framework for J1939 CAN communication, validated via HIL testing and real-world deployment on an electrified compact track loader. Includes a Qt-based dashboard for control and monitoring, addressing integration challenges for off-road/heavy-duty EVs. Promotes standardized J1939 implementation.
