# ev-2025

A generalized framework for J1939 CAN communication, validated via HIL testing and real-world deployment on an electrified compact track loader. Includes a Qt-based dashboard for control and monitoring, addressing integration challenges for off-road/heavy-duty EVs. Promotes standardized J1939 implementation.

Hello,

I am **Sujeendra Ramesh**, and this innovative software framework was developed as part of my master's thesis at the **University of Minnesota, Twin Cities**, in the field of robotics in 2025.

This project is a part of [**Dr. Li's Lab**](https://sites.google.com/umn.edu/perry-li/research/miml?authuser=0), and the project name is **HHEA (Hybrid Hydraulic Electric Architecture)**. I would like to extend my gratitude to my entire team, including:

- Dr. Li
- Jim
- Ravi
- Jackson
- Jacob
- Mahmud
- Zihao
- Professor Severson

This work is supported by the **U.S. Department of Energy Office of Energy Efficiency and Renewable Energyâ€™s (EERE) Vehicle Technologies Office (VTO)** under grant number **DE-EE0009875**. Their support has been instrumental in enabling the research and development presented in this thesis.
